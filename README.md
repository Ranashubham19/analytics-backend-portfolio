# 🚨 System Alert – REST API Integration & Alert System

A production-style **REST API Integration & Alert System** built using Python and FastAPI.
This project continuously consumes external REST APIs, processes JSON responses, and triggers
threshold-based alerts with proper logging and scheduling.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system is designed to simulate real-world backend monitoring services.
It integrates with third-party REST APIs, validates and processes responses, and generates
alerts when predefined thresholds are crossed.

The project follows clean backend architecture and demonstrates API handling,
error management, and scheduled execution.
